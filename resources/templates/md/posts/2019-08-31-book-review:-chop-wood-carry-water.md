### Chop Wood Carry Water: How to Fall in Love with the Process of Becoming Great

A short, pleasant read. Some part of me has always been attracted to mastery. By mastery, I'm specifically talking about human mastery of a skill, often a complex, compound and valuable one, the ones that need 10000+ hours. This is a story about a human's journey from dream to achievement under a Sensei. Pretty cringy stuff but there's some good stuff hidden amidst the cliches. I particularly liked reading about the dangerous allure of partially controllable goals and the eternal vigilance towards the person we become during the journey. All in all, 5 stars.
